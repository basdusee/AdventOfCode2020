# AdventOfCode2020

This is my 2020 submission for AdventOfCode.

I very much follow the following rules while creating code:
 * first make something that WORKS
 * then make it PROPER
 * then make it FAST

For AdventOfCode of course "WORKS" is good enough, so most code is just garbage giving the right answer.

Also, I did this in Rust where I'm not overly skilled in. Most code looks very weird due to elaborate fights with the borrow checker.
Some code looks okay from the outside, though. My main purpose of doing this excercise is learning, which i did a lot. I did try to properly comment the code for when I'm  reviewing this in a year, or for the lost soul who actually reads this.

You can run this yourself by cloning the repo, going to the dayX folder and run "cargo run" in the root of the dayX folder. Please first install Rust of course (and cargo with it).
It's pretty self-explanatory. I practically did a "cargo new dayX" for every new day. No fancy challenge build system, I'm too lazy to make such a thing (and I do not have the time).

If you are a corporate recruiter and are impressed by this code while you were searching for a Rust programmer, and you have te urge to contact and contract me, please don't. I'm doing this for fun. Go away.
If you are a recruiter and aren't at all impressed by this code and still want to try and hire me, then please A) let your mental health examined by a professional or B) you are one of those clueless internet headhunters. Please both types, go away also.
I can't facilitate professional mental health threatment and I'm not what agressive idiotic headhunters are looking for.

That aside, if you are an amateur programmer like me, and you like Rust and like participating in challenges where people who properly can code, are attending too, just do the Advent of Code and inspirate yourself on my clumsy attempts.
