# AdventOfCode2020

This is my 2020 submission for AdventOfCode.

I very much follow the following rules while creating code:
 * first make something that WORKS
 * then make it PROPER
 * then make it FAST

For AdventOfCode of course "WORKS" is good enough, so most code is just garbage giving the right answer.

Also, I did this in Rust where I'm not overly skilled in. Most code looks very weird due to elaborate fights with the borrow checker.
